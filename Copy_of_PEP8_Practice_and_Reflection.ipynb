        "The 3 pep 8 rules that will most improve my code is the naming rule, the maximum line rule, and the indentation rule. This is because I tend to write a lot when I program. I am not an orginized person so when I code, I wouldn't break up a line of code into multiple lines if it was too long. Rather, I would just fit as much as I could. I am also not used to using underscores when naming variables as opposed to spaces. This is because in the english language, spaces are used to seperate words so therefore, I am used to it. The indentation rule will impact my code the most since it's the rule that makes ones code the most readable. As I said before, I am not an orginized person so when I code, I won't care about indentations and making the code more readable. When I started to indent, I felt my code was easier to read. Here is a small code snippet from a previous assignment:\n",
        "if a>0 and b>0 and c>0 and a+b>c and a+c>b and b+c>a:\n",
        "  if a==b==c:\n",

        "    print(\"Scalene\")\n",
        "  First, I would take the first line and break it down into more lines since I feel like it is too long and there are too many consitions squeezed together. The second change I would make is that I would put a space between the operators >, ==, !=.\n",
        "  It is reasoable to break pep 8 when the code would be less readable if you were to follow it. I would write a short inline comment in the place where I broke pep 8 and explain why. I disagreed with the rule regarding inline comments. Pep 8 states there, \"Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state the obvious.\" I disagree because not all people reading the code are as experienced.

Therefore, x=10 was changed to SCALE = 10. Next, the function name DO() is incorrect as names need to be lowercase with underscores in between unless it is a constant. Therefore, the function name was changed to multiply_by_global. Regarding the name SCALE, since the variable is a constant the name is allowed to be capitalized. Constant variable names are typically capitalized with underscores in between. Also what is changed is that after the function name, there is an indent (4 spaces) before the next statement. In the original, the function name and the statement return x*X are on the same line."
